### **Exercise 1**

1. What is the difference between `17/4` and `17//4`?

2. Print `"It's too early in the morning"`

3. Using the numbers 4 and 6 the math operations: +, -, *, / print the number 8.

4. If `x="abcde"`, then what are `x[0]`, x[-1]`, and `x[1:]`?


### **Exercise 2**
Try the following:

    myfirstlist.append(5)
    myfirstlist.insert(1,5)
    myfirstlist.sort()
    myfirstlist.reverse()
    myfirstlist.count(5)
    myfirstlist.remove(5)

Lists are associated with built-in ‘methods’ which is what you saw in the above exercise.


### **Exercise 3**

-   Write a Python script to check if a number is even or odd or zero.


### **Exercise 4**

-   Write a script which determines whether a number `n` is prime or not.  Use the definition of a prime number as one with only two factors---one and the number itself.


### **Exercise 5**

Modify the previous exercise (to check for a prime number), to a function `isprime`.


### **Exercise 6**

Create a new Python script using `isprime` in which you declare a list of numbers `x=[1, 2, ..., 100]` and loop through the numbers in the list to count the number of prime numbers.

-   (use `range(1,101)` or generate by remove first element of list `range(101).pop(0)` or `range(101).remove(0)`
