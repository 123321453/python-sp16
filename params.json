  "body": "All workshops will be held in the EWS computer laboratory, L440 Digital Computer Laboratory.  There is no sign-up for this series—walk-ins are welcome and encouraged!\r\n\r\nL440 DCL is a little tricky to find if you haven't been there before.  It's located in the basement, and can be accessed by going down the main staircase in DCL and turning right.\r\n\r\n![](./img/map-l440.png)\r\n\r\nFor most of the lessons, we will require outside modules.  We will provide a Python *virtual environment* in class, which will run on the EWS machine and let you access all of the modules required.  [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) is an excellent Python distribution for your personal machine.\r\n\r\n**Please find any necessary setup directions for today's workshop below.**\r\n\r\n# Introduction to Python\r\n#### Feb. 16, Noon–2:00 p.m.\r\n\r\n-   [Exercises](./lessons/intro-exercises.md)\r\n-   [Data set #1](./lessons/data/microarray.csv)\r\n-   [Data set #2](./lessons/data/wheres-waldo-locations.csv)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Scientific Computing (`numpy`, `scipy`)\r\n#### Feb. 23, Noon–2:00 p.m. (`numpy`)\r\n#### Feb. 24, Noon–2:00 p.m. (`scipy`)\r\n\r\n-   Open a new Terminal and run the setup code below to prepare your EWS machine to run our Python lesson today.  This will download the data we will work with and the NumPy notebook.
